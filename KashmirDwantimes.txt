As The Economist tersely summed up “Narendra Modi, pushed two bills through parliament that cleave the state in two and scrapped what autonomy it still enjoyed. Under the new regime, Kashmir is ruled directly from Delhi, the national capital. The reorganisation promised to replace corrupt politicians, to attract investment and prosperity and to bring lasting peace.

“Two years on, none of these aims has been realised. No new political class has been mustered to represent the Kashmiri people at home or in Delhi; unemployment, at 21 [per cent] is the highest in India; and killings of all kinds rattle Srinagar….”

This did not inhibit Amit Shah when he descended on the Kashmir Valley. On Oct 25, on the conclusion of his tour, he boasted, “Dr Farooq Sahib has suggested that I talk to Pakistan. If I will talk, I will talk only to the people of J&K and its youth, no one else.”

This is the latest in a series of fiats in the last 50 years or so — in effect he is saying that there is nothing about which to talk to Pakistanis ie it is not a party to the Kashmir dispute.

It was a BJP government which set up a backchannel on Kashmir in 1999. In 2001, it was this very government which held summit talks with president Pervez Musharraf at Agra. In 2005-2006, president Musharraf and prime minister Manmohan Singh came within inches of a settlement of Kashmir. Small men on all three sides sabotaged it. Kashmiri separatists misled by Shah Geelani opposed it tooth and nail. Manmohan Singh had to battle within his cabinet and party. And in Pakistan some retired diplomats whipped up opposition.
